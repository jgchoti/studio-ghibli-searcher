# Studio Ghibli API Search Application

## Introduction

The Studio Ghibli API Search Application is designed to interact with the Studio Ghibli API 
to perform searches and retrieve information from the Studio Ghibli movie database. 
This application was developed as part of my studies with HackYourFuture Belgium, aimed at deepening my understanding of JavaScript, 
particularly in the realm of Fetching Data: using fetch and async/await.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to implement the following features for interacting with the Studio Ghibli API:

- Searching Entities: Users can search for various entities within the Studio Ghibli universe, such as movies, characters, locations, and species.
- Viewing Details: Users can view detailed information about specific entities retrieved from the Studio Ghibli API, including attributes, descriptions, and associated data.
- Filtering Results: Users can apply filters to narrow down search results based on specific criteria (e.g., director, release year, genre).
- API Integration: Integrate with the Studio Ghibli API to fetch real-time data and handle API responses.
- Error Handling: Provide error messages to users in case of invalid searches or API errors.
- Pagination: Implement pagination for search results to handle large datasets effectively.

## What I Have Learned During This Project

- JavaScript Fundamentals: Strengthened my understanding of event handling, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming using fetch and async/await.
- API Integration: Learned to effectively fetch data from external APIs and handle responses and errors.
- Error Handling: Implemented error handling to improve user experience when encountering issues with the API or user input.
- Separation of Concerns: Organized code into modular components to separate UI, logic, and data handling for better maintainability.
- Pagination Implementation: Implemented pagination to enhance user experience and manage large datasets efficiently.

## Future Development Goals

Looking forward, my aim is to expand the functionality of this project. This includes implementing features such as:
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible and usable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Additional API Features: Explore and integrate additional features offered by the Studio Ghibli API, such as retrieving images, trailers, or reviews.
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication and personalized features, such as saving favorite movies or creating watchlists.
- Enhanced UI/UX: Continuously improve the user interface and experience based on feedback and usability testing.
